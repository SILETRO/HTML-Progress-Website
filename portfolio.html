                    This one was the hardest to make. I remember browsing till the 5th google page. Who even needs to search that far? Have you ever?
                    <br>To get the most accurate weather, I have linked the program to the weather API that fetches data from the most accurate sources.
                </p>
                <p>So basically, Assistant Sil is a program that helps you search your way across the 
                    web. Say you want to listen to a song or search for images of the Kardishians before surgery, you just have to type it out and then you'll be directed promptly to the corresponding page. Youtube for the song, and google for the images.

                </h1>
                <p>Now comes this website. It was the most nerve-wracking thing I have ever done. The
                    first two pages were a piece of cake to make and were fun too, but it all began to fall apart on this page. I had to restructure the whole page just because it wasn't very responsive on smartphones. 
                    <br>Still, the whole project was real fun to make.
                    If you're reading this, do appreciate my hard work xD
                </p>
                <p>At first I wanted to add some images in the website but then realized a more     
                    minimilistic theme would be cooler. Also, let me know if you guys want more stuff to be added in this website!   
                    <br>The whole project was real fun to make and probably my favourite of all I've made so far.
